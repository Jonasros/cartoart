# Map Poster Design Guide

This document covers the design principles, color theory, typography rules, and aesthetic considerations needed to produce genuinely beautiful map posters - not just functional ones.

---

## Part 1: Color Theory Fundamentals

### The Basics

**Hue**: The color itself (red, blue, green)
**Saturation**: Intensity/purity of the color (vivid vs muted)
**Lightness/Value**: How light or dark the color is

For map posters, we're primarily working with **low-saturation palettes**. Highly saturated colors fight for attention and create visual noise - the opposite of what we want for an elegant print.

### Color Relationships

**Monochromatic**: Single hue, varying saturation and lightness
- Safest choice, almost impossible to make ugly
- Creates cohesion and sophistication
- Example: Navy streets on cream background, with mid-blue for water

**Analogous**: Adjacent colors on the wheel (e.g., blue-green-teal)
- Harmonious and pleasing
- Good for terrain maps with natural color transitions
- Example: Forest greens fading to blue for water

**Complementary**: Opposite colors on the wheel
- Use sparingly - one dominant, one accent
- Creates vibrant contrast when needed
- Example: Deep blue background with gold/amber accent lines

**Split-Complementary**: One color + two colors adjacent to its complement
- More nuanced than direct complementary
- Allows for richer palettes without clash

### Saturation Rules for Map Posters

1. **Background**: Very low saturation or neutral (0-15%)
2. **Primary features (streets)**: Low to medium saturation (15-40%)
3. **Secondary features (water, parks)**: Medium saturation okay (30-50%)
4. **Accents**: Can push saturation higher, but use sparingly

### Value Contrast is King

More important than color choice is **value contrast** - the difference in lightness between elements.

**High contrast** (dark on light, light on dark):
- More dramatic, modern, graphic
- Easier to read from distance
- Better for minimal styles

**Low contrast** (similar values, different hues):
- Subtle, sophisticated, artistic
- Requires closer viewing
- Better for watercolor/vintage styles

**The Squint Test**: Squint at your design. If elements disappear, you need more value contrast. If it's harsh and jarring, you may have too much.

### Temperature

**Warm colors** (reds, oranges, yellows, warm browns): Feel inviting, nostalgic, energetic
**Cool colors** (blues, greens, purples): Feel calm, modern, professional

Most successful map posters lean **cool or neutral**, with warm accents. Full warm palettes can feel dated or kitschy unless handled carefully (vintage style being the exception).

## Part 2: Color Palettes for Each Style

### Minimal Line Art

The palette should disappear - you notice the lines, not the colors.

**Classic Combos**:
- Charcoal (#2D2D2D) on off-white (#F5F5F0)
- Navy (#1E3A5F) on cream (#FDF6E3)
- White (#FFFFFF) on soft black (#1A1A1A)
- Warm gray (#4A4A4A) on warm white (#FAF8F5)

**Rules**:
- Maximum 2-3 colors total
- Background should be the dominant visual
- Lines should feel like ink or graphite
- Avoid pure black (#000000) and pure white (#FFFFFF) - they're harsh

**Palette Examples**:

```
Palette: "Ink & Paper"
Background: #F7F5F0 (warm white)
Streets: #2C2C2C (soft black)
Water: #B8C5D0 (muted blue-gray)
Parks: #C5CBBA (muted sage)
Text: #2C2C2C
```

```
Palette: "Midnight"
Background: #0D1B2A (deep navy)
Streets: #E0E1DD (off-white)
Water: #1B263B (slightly lighter navy)
Parks: #1B263B (same as water - monochrome)
Text: #E0E1DD
```

```
Palette: "Blush"
Background: #F8F4F1 (warm cream)
Streets: #6B5B5B (dusty mauve-brown)
Water: #D4E4ED (pale blue)
Parks: #E2E8DC (pale sage)
Text: #4A3F3F (dark mauve)
```

### Dark Mode / Noir

Drama through darkness. The city should feel like it glows.

**Key Principle**: The background isn't just dark - it's rich. Pure black (#000000) is lifeless. Use deep, saturated darks instead.

**Classic Combos**:
- Gold (#D4AF37) lines on black (#0A0A0A)
- White (#F5F5F5) on deep navy (#0B1929)
- Cyan (#00D4FF) on charcoal (#1A1A2E)
- Rose gold (#E8B4B8) on deep purple (#1A0A1A)

**Rules**:
- Background: 5-15% lightness, can have color
- Lines: 80-100% lightness, or metallic/jewel tones
- Water: Slightly lighter than background, or accent color
- Glow effects can be simulated with slightly lighter halos

**Palette Examples**:

```
Palette: "Gold Standard"
Background: #0A0A0A (near black)
Streets: #D4AF37 (gold)
Major Streets: #E8C547 (bright gold)
Water: #1A1A2E (dark blue-black)
Parks: #0F1A0F (dark forest)
Text: #D4AF37 (gold)
```

```
Palette: "Neon Noir"
Background: #0B0B1A (deep blue-black)
Streets: #FFFFFF (white)
Major Streets: #00F5FF (cyan)
Water: #0F1A2E (dark blue)
Parks: #0A1F0A (dark green)
Text: #FFFFFF
```

```
Palette: "Rose Night"
Background: #1A0F14 (deep burgundy-black)
Streets: #F5E6E8 (pale pink-white)
Major Streets: #E8B4B8 (rose gold)
Water: #1A1A2E (dark navy)
Parks: #0F1A14 (dark teal-black)
Text: #E8B4B8 (rose gold)
```

### Blueprint / Technical

Precision and clarity. Should feel like a technical drawing or architectural plan.

**Key Principle**: Blueprints aren't actually bright blue - they're deep, slightly desaturated blue with high-contrast white/cyan lines.

**Classic Combos**:
- White (#FFFFFF) on Prussian blue (#003153)
- Cyan (#7DF9FF) on navy (#001F3F)
- Light blue (#B0D4F1) on dark blue (#0A2342)

**Rules**:
- Grid overlays enhance the technical feel
- Line weights matter more here - vary thickness for hierarchy
- Consider adding coordinate markers or scale references
- Typography should be technical/mechanical

**Palette Examples**:

```
Palette: "Classic Blueprint"
Background: #0A2647 (Prussian blue)
Streets: #E8F1F5 (blue-white)
Major Streets: #FFFFFF (white)
Grid: #1A3A5C (lighter blue, subtle)
Water: #082540 (darker blue)
Parks: #0A3040 (blue-green hint)
Text: #E8F1F5
```

```
Palette: "Architect"
Background: #1C2833 (dark blue-gray)
Streets: #AED6F1 (light cyan)
Major Streets: #D4E6F1 (pale blue)
Grid: #2E4053 (medium blue-gray)
Water: #1B2631 (slightly different dark)
Text: #D4E6F1
```

### Vintage / Antique

Warmth and nostalgia. Should feel like a treasured old document.

**Key Principle**: Nothing should look "new." Colors are muted, slightly yellowed, as if aged. Contrast is softer.

**Classic Combos**:
- Sepia (#5D4E37) on parchment (#F4E4BC)
- Dark brown (#3C2415) on cream (#FFF8E7)
- Faded ink (#4A4A48) on aged paper (#EDE0C8)

**Rules**:
- No pure whites - everything has warmth
- Black becomes dark brown or sepia
- Blues become blue-grays
- Greens become olive or sage
- Consider subtle paper texture overlay

**Palette Examples**:

```
Palette: "Parchment"
Background: #F4E4C8 (aged cream)
Streets: #5D4E37 (sepia brown)
Major Streets: #3C2F1F (dark brown)
Water: #B8C5C0 (faded blue-green)
Parks: #C5C4A8 (sage)
Text: #3C2F1F (dark brown)
Accent: #8B4513 (saddle brown for borders)
```

```
Palette: "Old Atlas"
Background: #EDE5D0 (warm off-white)
Streets: #4A4540 (warm dark gray)
Major Streets: #2F2A25 (near-black brown)
Water: #A8C0C8 (dusty blue)
Parks: #B8C4A8 (muted green)
Text: #2F2A25
Border: #8B7355 (tan)
```

### Watercolor / Painted

Soft, organic, artistic. Should feel hand-made and gentle.

**Key Principle**: Edges are soft, colors bleed into each other. Nothing is precise. Saturation can be higher than other styles because the softness diffuses it.

**Classic Combos**:
- Soft grays and blues with touches of warm pink
- Earthy greens and browns with blue water
- Monochrome washes in a single hue family

**Rules**:
- Avoid hard edges anywhere
- Water should be the most saturated element (it's the hero)
- Parks can have texture/variation
- Streets become suggestions, not precise lines
- Consider paper texture overlay

**Palette Examples**:

```
Palette: "Coastal Wash"
Background: #FAF8F5 (warm white)
Streets: #9CA5A8 (blue-gray)
Water: #7BA3B8 (ocean blue, more saturated)
Parks: #A8B89C (soft green)
Land Wash: #E8E4DE (subtle warm gray)
Text: #4A5568 (cool gray)
```

```
Palette: "Spring Garden"
Background: #FFFEF9 (cream)
Streets: #8B8680 (warm gray)
Water: #89A8C4 (periwinkle blue)
Parks: #9AB89A (fresh green)
Accent: #D4A89A (blush pink for buildings)
Text: #5C524C (warm dark gray)
```

### Topographic / Contour

Scientific but beautiful. The terrain tells the story.

**Key Principle**: The contour lines create natural visual rhythm. Color should support this, not fight it.

**Classic Combos**:
- Brown contours on cream (classic USGS)
- Single color contours with varying lightness for elevation
- Blue-green gradients from low to high elevation

**Rules**:
- Contour line weight and spacing matter enormously
- Consider elevation-based color (hypsometric tints)
- Water should clearly contrast with land
- Too many colors = visual chaos

**Palette Examples**:

```
Palette: "Survey"
Background: #F5F2E8 (cream)
Contours: #8B7355 (tan-brown)
Index Contours: #5C4830 (dark brown, every 5th)
Water: #B8D4E8 (clear blue)
Streams: #7BA3C4 (medium blue)
Text: #3C3020 (dark brown)
```

```
Palette: "Terrain Night"
Background: #1A1A2E (dark blue)
Contours: #4A90A4 (teal)
Index Contours: #6BB8C8 (bright teal)
Water: #0F3460 (deep blue)
Peaks: #E8E8E8 (near white for highest)
Text: #B8C5D0 (light gray-blue)
```

### Abstract / Artistic

Rules are looser here - it's art first, map second.

**Key Principle**: Use map data as raw material. The final result should be visually striking, even if not immediately readable as a map.

**Possibilities**:
- Neighborhoods as color blocks (inspired by risk board game)
- Street networks as flowing organic shapes
- Building footprints as geometric patterns
- Layered transparencies creating depth

**Rules**:
- Have a clear visual concept before choosing colors
- Contrast and composition matter more than "accuracy"
- Can use full saturation if intentional
- Typography becomes part of the art

## Part 3: Typography

### Type Hierarchy

Every poster needs clear hierarchy:

1. **Location Name** (Primary): The hero text. Large, prominent, memorable.
2. **Subtitle** (Secondary): Supporting info - coordinates, country, custom text. Smaller, lighter weight.
3. **Optional Tertiary**: Date, scale, attribution. Very small, unobtrusive.

**Size Relationships**:
- Primary: 100% (baseline)
- Secondary: 40-50% of primary
- Tertiary: 25-30% of primary

### Font Pairing Rules

**Rule 1: Contrast or Match**
Either use fonts that are clearly different (serif + sans-serif) or use the same family with different weights. The middle ground looks like a mistake.

**Rule 2: One Star**
One font should dominate. The other supports. Don't let them compete.

**Rule 3: Limit to Two**
Maximum two font families per design. Three is almost always too many.

**Rule 4: Match the Era/Style**
- Minimal/Modern → Geometric sans-serifs
- Vintage → Classic serifs, scripts
- Technical → Monospace, industrial sans
- Artistic → Display faces, hand-lettered styles

### Font Recommendations by Style

**Minimal Line Art**:
- Primary: **Inter**, **Helvetica Neue**, **DM Sans**, **Outfit**
- Secondary: Same family, lighter weight
- Character: Clean, contemporary, invisible

**Dark Mode / Noir**:
- Primary: **Montserrat**, **Poppins**, **Bebas Neue**, **Oswald**
- Secondary: Same family or **Space Mono** for contrast
- Character: Bold, modern, cinematic

**Blueprint / Technical**:
- Primary: **JetBrains Mono**, **IBM Plex Mono**, **Space Mono**, **Roboto Mono**
- Secondary: Same family
- Character: Precise, mechanical, drafting-table

**Vintage / Antique**:
- Primary: **Playfair Display**, **Crimson Text**, **Libre Baskerville**, **EB Garamond**
- Secondary: **Lora**, or same family in italic
- Accent: **Great Vibes** or **Tangerine** for flourishes (use sparingly)
- Character: Elegant, classic, storied

**Watercolor / Painted**:
- Primary: **Cormorant Garamond**, **Spectral**, **Lora**
- Secondary: **Josefin Sans** (light weight)
- Accent: **Caveat**, **Kalam** for hand-written feel
- Character: Soft, organic, personal

**Topographic / Contour**:
- Primary: **Source Serif Pro**, **Merriweather**, **Noto Serif**
- Secondary: **Source Sans Pro**, **Work Sans**
- Character: Scientific, readable, authoritative

**Abstract / Artistic**:
- More freedom here - can use display faces
- **Archivo Black**, **Anton**, **Righteous** for impact
- Or go minimal with **Space Grotesk**, **Syne**
- Character: Whatever serves the concept

### Typography Spacing

**Letter-spacing (Tracking)**:
- Large text (titles): Slight positive tracking (+2-5%) opens it up, adds elegance
- Small text (subtitles): Normal or slight negative tracking for readability
- All-caps: Always needs positive tracking (+5-15%)

**Line-height (Leading)**:
- Titles: 1.0-1.2 (tight, since usually single line)
- Subtitles: 1.3-1.5 (if multi-line)
- Body text: 1.5-1.7 (not typically used on map posters)

**Margins and Positioning**:
- Text should never touch the edge - minimum margin of 3-5% of poster width
- Bottom positioning is most common and stable
- Center positioning is more formal/traditional
- Top positioning is modern/unexpected
- Text should align with an internal grid or map features when possible

### Typography Color

**On light backgrounds**:
- Don't use pure black (#000000) - it's too harsh
- Use the darkest color from your palette
- Or a dark warm gray (#2D2D2D to #4A4A4A)

**On dark backgrounds**:
- Don't use pure white (#FFFFFF) - it can glow/bloom
- Use the lightest color from your palette
- Off-white (#F5F5F5, #E8E8E8) is safer

**Accent colors in text**:
- Can work for subtitles or single words
- The accent should already exist in the map palette
- Don't introduce new colors just for text

---

## Part 4: Poster Composition

### The Golden Ratio and Rule of Thirds

**Rule of Thirds**: Divide the poster into 9 equal sections. Place important elements along the lines or at intersections.

For map posters:
- The "interesting" part of the map (downtown, coastline, landmark) should fall on a third line
- Text should align with third lines
- Don't center everything - it's static and boring

**Golden Ratio (1:1.618)**: Creates naturally pleasing proportions. Can inform:
- Text size relationships
- Margin sizes
- Position of key elements

### Negative Space

**Negative space is not wasted space.** It's what makes the design breathable and elegant.

For map posters:
- Don't fill the entire canvas with dense map data
- Allow the background to frame the map
- Text needs room around it to breathe
- Margins should be generous (5-10% of width minimum)

### Visual Weight and Balance

Every element has visual weight:
- Dark elements are heavier than light
- Large elements are heavier than small
- Saturated colors are heavier than muted
- Dense areas (downtown) are heavier than sparse (suburbs)

**Balance doesn't mean symmetry.** A large light area can balance a small dark area.

Consider:
- If the map is dense on one side, position text on the other
- If using bold typography, keep the map simpler
- If the map is very detailed, use minimal text

### Focal Point

Every good poster has one clear focal point - where the eye goes first.

Options for map posters:
1. **The map itself**: Text is secondary, map dominates
2. **The location name**: Large text is the hero, map is backdrop
3. **A specific feature**: Coastline, river, mountain, landmark

Decide which it is and design accordingly. If everything competes for attention, nothing wins.

### Common Aspect Ratios

- **2:3** (24x36", 20x30"): Most common poster ratio, vertical feels natural
- **3:4** (18x24"): Slightly wider, good for horizontal maps
- **4:5** (16x20"): Portrait-like, works well for square-ish cities
- **1:1** (Square): Modern, works well for Instagram, bold choice for print
- **ISO sizes** (A1, A2): 1:√2 ratio, common in Europe

**Recommendation**: Default to 2:3 portrait, it's the most versatile for print.

---

## Part 5: Visual Polish

### Anti-aliasing and Line Quality

- All lines should be anti-aliased (smooth, not jagged)
- Line thickness should be appropriate for print size
- What looks good on screen may be too thin for print
- Test: Will this 1px line be visible at 24x36"?

**Line Width Guidelines** (at 300 DPI print):
- Minor streets: 1-2pt (0.35-0.7mm)
- Major streets: 2-4pt (0.7-1.4mm)
- Highways: 4-6pt (1.4-2.1mm)
- Borders: 2-4pt
- Contour lines: 0.5-1pt

### Texture and Grain

Subtle texture can add warmth and tactile quality:
- Paper texture for vintage styles
- Film grain for noir/dark styles
- Noise for watercolor/painted styles

**Rules**:
- Texture should be subtle - if you notice it first, it's too strong
- Apply at the end, as an overlay
- Consider that texture may not survive printing well at small sizes

### Shadows and Depth

Generally avoid drop shadows on map posters - they rarely add value and often look dated.

Exceptions:
- Subtle shadow on text over busy map areas (for legibility)
- Isometric/3D styles where shadow indicates elevation

If using shadows:
- Very soft blur (large radius)
- Low opacity (10-30%)
- Neutral color (dark version of background, not black)

### Borders and Frames

**No border**: Modern, clean, map bleeds to edge
**Thin line border**: Classic, contained, works for minimal styles
**Thick border**: Bold, poster-like, good for vintage
**Double line border**: Traditional, cartographic

**Inset/margin border** (map doesn't reach edge):
- Creates breathing room
- Background color shows around map
- Very elegant, highly recommended

**Border colors**:
- Same as text color
- Accent color from palette
- Avoid introducing new colors

### Color Mistakes
- ❌ Too many colors (more than 5)
- ❌ Overly saturated colors
- ❌ Pure black and pure white
- ❌ Colors that don't appear in the map appearing in text
- ❌ Equal visual weight for all elements

### Typography Mistakes
- ❌ More than 2 font families
- ❌ Fonts that don't match the style era
- ❌ Text too close to edges
- ❌ All caps without increased letter-spacing
- ❌ Competing hierarchy (everything is big)
- ❌ Illegible text over busy map areas

### Composition Mistakes
- ❌ Perfectly centered everything (boring)
- ❌ No clear focal point
- ❌ Map too dense/busy
- ❌ No breathing room (margins too small)
- ❌ Important features cut off at edges awkwardly

### Style Mistakes
- ❌ Mixing styles that don't belong together

## Part 8: GPX Route Styling

Routes add a dynamic storytelling element to map posters - they show journeys, adventures, and personal experiences overlaid on geographic data.

### Route Design Philosophy

**Purpose**: Routes transform a static map into a narrative. The route should feel like a natural part of the composition, not a jarring addition.

**Key Principle**: The route is the hero of the poster when present. Design choices should support this while maintaining harmony with the underlying map style.

### Route Color Selection

**Contrast is Essential**: The route must be clearly visible against all map elements it crosses (water, land, streets, parks).

**Style-Appropriate Colors**:

**Minimal Line Art**:
- Use the accent color or a muted version of text color
- Coral (#E07A5F), Terracotta (#C17767), Muted Red (#A85C50)
- Avoid bright colors that break the minimal aesthetic

**Dark Mode / Noir**:
- Jewel tones work beautifully: Ruby (#E63946), Electric Blue (#00D4FF), Gold (#D4AF37)
- High-contrast colors make routes pop dramatically
- Can use gradients from start to end for elevation or time

**Blueprint / Technical**:
- Bright cyan (#7DF9FF) or white for primary route
- Creates a "planned path" appearance
- Consider dashed lines to match technical drawing conventions

**Vintage / Antique**:
- Warm, muted colors: Brick Red (#8B4513), Aged Coral (#C17767), Deep Rust (#9E5A4A)
- Should look like hand-drawn ink on old paper
- Avoid modern bright colors

**Watercolor / Painted**:
- Soft, slightly saturated: Rose (#D4A89A), Soft Coral (#E8B4A8), Muted Terracotta (#C9A78C)
- Route should have same "soft" feeling as the style
- Consider slightly irregular line edges

**Topographic / Contour**:
- Trail-marker colors work well: Trail Red (#C0392B), Blaze Orange (#E67E22)
- Or use contour colors for consistency
- Route becomes part of the terrain story

### Route Line Styles

**Solid Lines**:
- Clean, modern, confident
- Best for: Minimal, Dark Mode, Blueprint
- Recommended width: 3-6px screen, 4-8pt print

**Dashed Lines**:
- Technical, planned, intentional
- Best for: Blueprint, Topographic, Abstract
- Dash pattern: 10-15px dash, 5-8px gap

**Dotted Lines**:
- Softer, more organic, exploratory
- Best for: Watercolor, Vintage, hand-drawn styles
- Dot spacing: 6-10px

### Start/End Markers

**Visual Hierarchy**:
- Markers should be noticeable but not overwhelming
- Typically 1.5-2x the route line width
- Start and end can use different colors or same color

**Color Recommendations**:
- **Start**: Greens, teals - suggests beginning, nature, go
- **End**: Reds, corals - suggests destination, achievement, stop
- **Alternative**: Use route color for both, just different shapes

**Shape Options**:
- Circles: Universal, clean, works with all styles
- Flags: More dynamic, suggests waypoints
- Custom icons: For themed posters (hiking boot, bike, etc.)

### Route Width Guidelines

**Screen Display**:
- Minimum: 2px (may be hard to see)
- Recommended: 3-5px
- Maximum: 8px (route becomes dominant)

**Print Export** (at 300 DPI):
- Minimum: 2pt (0.7mm)
- Recommended: 4-6pt (1.4-2.1mm)
- Maximum: 8pt (2.8mm)

**Rule of Thumb**: Route width should be similar to or slightly thicker than major streets.

### Route Opacity

**Full Opacity (100%)**:
- Route is clearly the focus
- Works for minimal maps with less detail
- Best for dark mode styles

**Medium Opacity (70-85%)**:
- Route is prominent but map shows through
- Good balance for most styles
- Helps route integrate with map

**Lower Opacity (50-70%)**:
- More subtle, artistic integration
- Good for watercolor and vintage styles
- May need thicker line to compensate

### Composition with Routes

**Route Placement**:
- Unlike point locations, routes determine their own positioning
- Ensure route fits entirely within margins
- Auto-fit should center the route with appropriate padding

**Text Placement**:
- Avoid placing text directly over the route
- If route crosses text area, consider text backdrop
- Route statistics (distance, elevation) can complement main text

**Visual Balance**:
- Routes add visual weight
- If route is in one corner, balance with text in opposite area
- Dense route sections are "heavier" than sparse sections

### Privacy Zones

**Purpose**: Allow users to hide sensitive start/end points (home, workplace).

**Visual Approach**:
- Route fades or is clipped at privacy zone boundaries
- Creates natural-looking endpoints
- Privacy radius should be generous (200-1000m)

**Design Consideration**: The "hidden" portion shouldn't look like an error - it should feel intentional, like the journey simply begins and ends at those points.
