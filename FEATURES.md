## In Progress: Cartographic Enhancements

Adopting high-value features from the upstream carto-art repository to enhance poster design capabilities.

### Scale Bar ✅

Dynamic distance scale for professional cartographic output.

- ✅ Haversine formula for accurate ground distance
- ✅ Auto-switches from meters to kilometers at 1000m
- ✅ Position options (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right)
- ✅ Color picker matching poster palette
- ✅ Renders correctly in PNG export

### Compass Rose (Next Up)

SVG compass for circular poster formats — adds a nautical/expedition feel.

- [ ] 8 cardinal/intercardinal directions (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW)
- [ ] 24 intermediate tick marks at 15° intervals
- [ ] Uses palette accent color
- [ ] Only renders on circular mask posters
- [ ] Renders in PNG export

**Config exists**: `format.compassRose?: boolean` — just needs component implementation.

### Custom Markers System (Planned)

Enable users to annotate posters with multiple custom location markers.

- [ ] Multiple markers per poster (not just center)
- [ ] 6 marker types: pin, crosshair, dot, ring, heart, home
- [ ] Color and size customization per marker
- [ ] Optional labels with 4 styles (standard, elevated, glass, vintage)
- [ ] Marker path lines connecting points
- [ ] Fill polygon option for marked areas

**Use case**: Mark trail highlights, summit points, rest stops, photo spots.

## Future Phases

### Phase 2: Sailing & Voyage Maps

- Nautical mile display
- Port markers for stops
- Nautical chart styling
- Ocean-themed palettes

**Why this niche**: Less crowded, higher price tolerance, already supports routes.

### Phase 3: Advanced Terrain (Deferred)

- Ray-marched terrain shadows with deck.gl
- Configurable light direction (azimuth/altitude)
- Shadow darkness and tint controls

**Why deferred**: Complex implementation, deck.gl dependency, focus on print features first.
