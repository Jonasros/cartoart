## In Progress: Cartographic Enhancements

Adopting high-value features from the upstream carto-art repository to enhance poster design capabilities.

### Scale Bar ✅

Dynamic distance scale for professional cartographic output.

- ✅ Haversine formula for accurate ground distance
- ✅ Auto-switches from meters to kilometers at 1000m
- ✅ Position options (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right)
- ✅ Color picker matching poster palette
- ✅ Renders correctly in PNG export

### Compass Rose (Next Up)

SVG compass for circular poster formats — adds a nautical/expedition feel.

- [ ] 8 cardinal/intercardinal directions (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW)
- [ ] 24 intermediate tick marks at 15° intervals
- [ ] Uses palette accent color
- [ ] Only renders on circular mask posters
- [ ] Renders in PNG export

**Config exists**: `format.compassRose?: boolean` — just needs component implementation.

### Custom Markers System (Planned)

Enable users to annotate posters with multiple custom location markers.

- [ ] Multiple markers per poster (not just center)
- [ ] 6 marker types: pin, crosshair, dot, ring, heart, home
- [ ] Color and size customization per marker
- [ ] Optional labels with 4 styles (standard, elevated, glass, vintage)
- [ ] Marker path lines connecting points
- [ ] Fill polygon option for marked areas

**Use case**: Mark trail highlights, summit points, rest stops, photo spots.

## Future Phases

### Phase 2: Sailing & Voyage Maps

- Nautical mile display
- Port markers for stops
- Nautical chart styling
- Ocean-themed palettes

**Why this niche**: Less crowded, higher price tolerance, already supports routes.

### Phase 3: Advanced Terrain (Deferred)

- Ray-marched terrain shadows with deck.gl
- Configurable light direction (azimuth/altitude)
- Shadow darkness and tint controls

**Why deferred**: Complex implementation, deck.gl dependency, focus on print features first.

## 3D Sculpture Export Quality ✅ COMPLETED

**Status**: ✅ Fixed — Paid exports now deliver print-quality STL files (~400K triangles).

The export pipeline has been upgraded from browser-preview quality to professional print quality.

### Issues Fixed

| Issue | Status | Solution Implemented |
| ----- | ------ | -------------------- |
| Route tube faceted | ✅ Fixed | 24 radial segments for export (was 8), 12 for preview |
| Terrain mesh blocky | ✅ Fixed | 256×256 grid for high quality exports |
| Route decimation crude | ✅ Fixed | Douglas-Peucker algorithm preserves shape |
| Text hard to read | ✅ Fixed | 2048px canvas, 1.2mm engraving depth |
| Terrain smoothing weak | ✅ Fixed | Multi-pass Gaussian smoothing |
| Preview/export mismatch | ✅ Fixed | Settings sync (heightLimit, clearance, rotation) |
| No mesh validation | ⏳ Planned | Add watertight/manifold checks |

### Current Output Quality

| Printer Type | Max Supported | Waymarker Output | Status |
| ------------ | ------------- | ---------------- | ------ |
| Desktop FDM | 2-5 million | ~400K | Good |
| Resin SLA | 10-50 million | ~400K | Good |
| Industrial | 50+ million | ~400K | Good |

### Export Quality Presets (Implemented)

| Preset | Route Segments | Terrain Grid | Est. Triangles | File Size |
|--------|----------------|--------------|----------------|-----------|
| Draft | 8 radial | 128×128 | ~50K | ~2MB |
| Standard | 16 radial | 192×192 | ~200K | ~10MB |
| **High Quality** | 24 radial | 256×256 | ~400K | ~20MB |
| Ultra | 32 radial | 384×384 | ~1M | ~50MB |

**Note**: Paid exports automatically use "High Quality" preset.

### Completed Implementation

- [x] Export quality presets system (draft, standard, high, ultra) ✅
- [x] Route tube radial segments (8 → 24 for export, 12 for preview) ✅
- [x] Douglas-Peucker algorithm for shape-preserving route simplification ✅
- [x] Multi-pass Gaussian smoothing for terrain surfaces ✅
- [x] Text improvements (2048px canvas, 1024×512 grid, 1.2mm depth) ✅
- [x] Terrain smoothing controls (0-3 passes configurable) ✅

**Export UX Improvements**:

- [x] Pre-export estimation UI (triangles, file size, generation time) ✅
- [x] Progress tracking during export with stage indicators ✅
- [x] Keep-tab-open warning for longer exports ✅

**Preview/Export Consistency**:

- [x] Sync terrainHeightLimit, routeClearance, routeDepth to export ✅
- [x] Apply terrainRotation to STL export (was preview-only) ✅
- [x] Route tube positioning aligned with terrain clearance ✅
- [x] Pass terrain mode to elevation grid for export ✅

**Additional Features**:

- [x] Route elevation source toggle (GPS data vs terrain snap) ✅
- [x] Route clearance optimization (terrain dips beneath raised routes) ✅
- [x] Auto-orientation of route start to front ✅

### Remaining Tasks

- [ ] Add mesh validation (manifold check, self-intersection detection)
- [ ] Add "Optimize for printing" post-processing step (vertex welding)
- [ ] Export quality selector in modal (currently auto-high for paid)
